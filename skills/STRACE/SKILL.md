description: >
  Optimize a multi-agent system's prompts or other components using trajectory data, 
  improve performance while reducing analysis cost — even at large scale.
  Use when the user wants to improve agent performance, revise prompts, or diagnose failures,
  and has execution traces available for analysis. Works at any scale: from a handful of traces to
  large collections. Do NOT use for building new agents from scratch, or when no traces exist.

# STRACE — Multi-Agent System Trace Analysis & Repair Pipeline

STRACE is a skill with a four-stage pipeline for diagnosing and improving multi-agent systems. 
Each stage is run as an independent subagent using instructions from `agents/`. 
Stages pass context forward via files written to `output/`.

## Step 0 — Triage (always run this first)

Before spawning any subagents, assess the situation and decide which stages to run.

**Check these signals:**

| Signal | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| `output/dependency_prior_analysis.md` exists | Skip Stage 1 |
| `output/high_priority_components.json` exists | Skip Stage 2 |
| Only 1 trace provided, or user points to a specific trace | Skip Stage 2 — go directly to Stage 3 |
| User already described which component is failing | Skip Stage 1 and Stage 2; treat user's description as system structure |
| User says "just fix the prompts" with attribution results available | Skip Stages 1–3, run Stage 4 only |
| User asks about manifestation node / "where does it fail?" | Note: this is answered as part of Stage 3 — no separate step needed |

**State your plan explicitly** before proceeding. Example:
> "You have 1 trace and no prior output. I'll run Stage 1 to map the system, then skip Stage 2 and
> go directly to Stage 3 to attribute the root cause. Stage 4 only if you want prompt fixes."

Then execute that plan. Do not enumerate possibilities — just commit to a path.

**Do NOT read agent files before completing triage.** Only load `agents/<stage>.md` immediately
before executing that stage — skip loading it entirely if the stage is not needed.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Stage 1: Environment-Modeling    →  output/dependency_prior_analysis.md
Stage 2: Trace-Selection         →  output/high_priority_components.json
                                    output/trace_summaries.json
Stage 3: Self-Debugging & Root Cause Attribution  →  output/attributions/<trace>.json  (one per trace)
Stage 4: Harness-Engineering         →  output/prompts_revised/<agent>_revised.md
```

Stages share context via files in `output/`. Each stage can be skipped if its output already exists
or the situation makes it unnecessary (see Step 0).

---

## Stage 1 — Environment-Modeling
*instructions: `agents/agent-env-modeling.md`*

Reads source code, prompts, and docs to catalog every component (decision-makers, executors, passive
state), infer data and control dependencies, and write a compact dependency prior list.

**Skip if**: `output/dependency_prior_analysis.md` already exists and reflects current codebase.  
**Output**: `output/dependency_prior_analysis.md`

---

## Stage 2 — Trace-Selection
*instructions: `agents/trace-selection.md`*

Statistically analyzes all traces to find the worst-performing components (failure rate × downstream
impact), then selects ≤5 representative traces per component covering distinct failure patterns.

**Skip if**: only small number of traces provided, user already knows which component to investigate, or
`output/high_priority_components.json` already exists.  
**Output**: `output/trace_summaries.json`, `output/high_priority_components.json`, `output/trace_analysis_report.md`

---

## Stage 3 — Self-Debugging & Root Cause Attribution
*instructions: `agents/trace-self-debug.md`*

For each trace, backtracks from the manifestation node to find the upstream component that actually
caused the failure. Spawn one subagent per trace; they can run in parallel.

**Skip if**: attribution results already exist in `output/attributions/`.  
**Output**: `output/attributions/<trace_filename>.json` per trace

After all subagents complete, summarize which components appear most as root causes — this is the
input to Stage 4.

---

## Stage 4 — Harness-Engineering
*instructions: `agents/harness-engineering.md`*

Synthesizes attribution results into targeted prompt edits. Produces gradient blocks per trace,
then revised prompt files. Validates that decision-maker / executor boundaries are not violated.

**Skip if**: user only wants diagnosis, not prompt fixes.  
**Output**: `output/prompts_revised/<name>_revised.md`, `output/prompt_mapping.json`

---

## Notes

- All output files land in `output/` — create it if it doesn't exist
- Each subagent is stateless; pass context explicitly (file paths, relevant file contents) in the prompt
- For Stage 3, parallel subagents are preferred — spawn all trace attribution agents in the same turn
- After Stage 4, ask the user whether they want to apply the revised prompts to their codebase
  (copy `output/prompts_revised/` → original prompt locations)

## Agents

- `agents/agent-env-modeling.md` — Stage 1
- `agents/trace-selection.md` — Stage 2
- `agents/trace-self-debug.md` — Stage 3
- `agents/harness-engineering.md` — Stage 4
